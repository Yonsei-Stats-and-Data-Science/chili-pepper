## Slurm

Slurm is a HPC job manager/scheduler that enables multiple scientists to use high performance computing clusters by submitting jobs(scripts to run for a certain time and resource configuration). The official documentation is very concise and therefore lacks some detail on configuring a custom cluster environment. This document aims sysadmins or users to understand the concept of slurm and its basic functionality along with naver cloud implementation.
