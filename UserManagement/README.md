## Enrollment for CPU Server

Since we start as a beta-test, collect people who wants to participate and use the compute machine. 

1. Create user via `adduser` and generate a random password. Store `id,pw` somewhere safe in a private local machine. 

2. Inform user their login details and instructions on how to use the server. 

    - Store data in the `Data/` folder for each users' home directory. This will be a directory in the NAS.

3. Create symlink to NAS.
